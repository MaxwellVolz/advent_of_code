# Advent of Code Solutions

# How to Run

- Navigate to folder for a given day
- Execute p1 or p2

# Creating new solutions

- Copy _template folder
- Paste question test in readme for that day
- Code it up!

# TODO

- catch up to **latest**
- snakeviz for performance handling
- rewrite solutions as practice being more *pythonic*
- maybe: jupyter notebooks explaining solution and thought process
